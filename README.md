# Data Structures and Algorithms
Todo: Dynamic Array w/ Ring Buffer, Union Find, Prefix&Suffix Tree

## Data Structures in C 
1. Queue
2. Stack
3. Circular Queue
4. Priority Queue(Max Heap implementation)

## Algorithms TODO
Binary search (implement it both iteratively and recursively)
Randomized quicksort (pay extra attention to the partition subroutine, as it’s useful in a lot of places)
Mergesort
Heapsort
Breadth-first search in a graph
Depth-first search in a graph (augment it to detect cycles)
Tree traversals (pre-order, in-order, post-order)
Topological sort (using Tarjan’s algorithm)
Dijkstra’s algorithm (without decrease-key)
Longest common subsequence (using dynamic programming with matrices)
Knapsack problem (also dynamic programming)
LRU Cache

## Bit Manipulation TODO

## NP TODO
Travelling salesman
